    "# Lab 1: Furuta pendulum measurements and actuation\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In this series of 3 labs we will control the Furuta pendulum pictured below to swing up its arm and balance it in the upright position.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Furuta Pendulum](img/lab1-furuta.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of machine learning concerns fitting a function to data. An artificial neural network (ANN) is for example a mapping from a an input vector $u$ to an output vector $y$, and can be represented by a (complicated) ordinary function $f:u\\to y$. In an ANN, $f$ is parameterized as a matrix of weights $W$. When the network is trained, the values of weights are adjusted to obtain $f(u;W)\\approx y$ for known data $(u,y)$. A strength of ANNs is that they are very flexible, meaning that they can approximate rather arbitrary mappings. This is also the reason that cross validation is so important to detect over-fitting of data. Particularly, the flexibity of $f$ becomes problematic if the training data is not sufficiently informative. This can be resolved by gathering additional training data. Sometimes this is expensive or even impossible. It is therefore always good to use as much prior knowledge as possible when modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum has a scalar (single-valued) real input $u$, that somehow relates to the angular velocity of its base, $\\dot{\\varphi}$. (The dot is convenient way to denote differentiation with respect to time, for example $\\dot{x}=dx/dt$). We will shortly take a closer look at properties of this input. The pendulum also provides two measurements: the base angle $\\varphi$ and the arm angle $\\theta$. We will take a closer look at them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being aspiring machine learning experts, we could now train a neural network to represent the mapping from the input $u$ to the output $y=[\\varphi~\\theta]$. This raises a number of questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How shall we choose the training input u, in order to cover the feature space that we are interested to model?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a good way to validate the model we obtain?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How can we use the obtained ANN to get closer to our goal of controlling the Furuta pendulum?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in this and the next lab, the Furuta pendulum has properties that enable us to restrict the search for a model to a much narrower class of mapping than ANNs provide, and this will prove useful when approaching the questions above. Incorporating knowledge of such properties into machine learning models is a recent research topic, and in order to get you on board, we will here focus on getting you familiar with \"classical\" modeling and control of dynamical systems, that is a pre-requisite for such composite models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first lab, the focus will lie on getting familiar with the Julia programming language, and getting started with experimenting on the physical Furuta pendulum. We will write functions for measuring angles and estimating angular velocies. Finally, we will develop a very simple model for the actuating DC motor. Lab 2 will focus on modelling and simulation, and in Lab 3 we will control the pendulum in the upright position, and also implement and energy-based conrol law that swings it up from its resting position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labs are all quite open-ended and exploratory. It is strongly encouraged that you experiment outside the boundaries of their manuals, and that you actively seek knowledge online and by interacting with the instructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To pass the lab fill all cells marked \"A\" with text or code, and be ready to discuss the content of the lab in a small group during the examination session.**"

    "The pendulum base is actuated by a permanent magnet brushless DC motor. Such motors are found in an abundance of application. Permanent magnet DC motors have a number of magnets configured on the rotor (the part that rotates) and a number of coils configured on the stator (the stationary part). The photo below shows what they look like on the inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stator coils](img/lab1-coils.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coils and magnets are grouped in groups of 3, making the motor electrically equivalent to the circuit diagram below.\n",

    "![3 phase BLDC motor](img/lab1-3phase.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The little switches are transistors, and by closing or opening them each phase of the motor can be exposed to either of the voltages $u_{\\min}$, $u_{\\max}$, or it can be left unconnected. Commutating the motor is the act of opening and closing these switches based on the relative position of the stator and the rotor. In a brushed DC motor, this is done automatically by brushes that gain and lose contact as the rotor rotates. In a brushless motor, commutation is instead done in software. This software is part of the firmware of the physical furuta pendulum unit. (Another essential part of the firmware handles communicaton with the PC, making it possible for us to issue control signals and read measurements from the device.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of the commutation firmware is to ensure that the right combination of switches are closed for the desired flux interactions between the permanent magnets and the magnetic field arising from running current through the phases. Typically (and indeed here) the desired flux interaction is the one that produces a driving torque, but it could also for instance be desired to commutate the motor such that the rotor is locked relative to the stator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the commutation switching is correctly handled (the firmware does it for us), the torque between the rotor and stator is proportional to the current drawn by the motor phases. A type of pulse width modulation (PWM) is used to control the phase currents. PWM is a very common technique for turning a binary control signal into an analog one by executing a periodic task where t$u=u_{\\max}$ for a fixed fraction $\\alpha$ of the period and $u=_{\\min}$ during the remainder. If the period is chosen short, it will appear as if the control signal was in fact $\\alpha u_{\\max}+(1-\\alpha)u_{\\min}$. This is for example the technique used to \"dim\" LED lights, that are turned on/off with high frequency rather than actually being dimmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sophisticated brushless DC motor controllers often measure the phase current and have feedback controller built into the firmware that tries to drive the phase current toward an external signal $u$. In this setting, the control signal $u$ is a torque reference, but it is often assumed that the feedback loop is fast and well-tuned and therefore that the motor torque in fact is $\\tau=u$."

The magnitude $|u|$ determines $\\alpha$ and the sign of $u$ determines whether the conrol signal will force turning in the positive or negative direction. The commutation frequency is fixed in the firmware to 20 kHz. From a dynamical modeling perspective, this makes our motor equivalent to a regular brushed DC motor (albeit one with virtual and always optimally positioned brushes), and we can model its electric properties using the standard model of a DC motor:\n",

The motor is also a generator (like the one in old bicycle dynamos) and as it spins, the same flux linkage that produces torque also induces a back-EMF, counteracting the driving voltage. The back-EMF is therefore proportional to $\\dot{\\varphi}$ with a motor-specific proportionality constant $k_v$, often referred to as the back-EMF constant.\n",
